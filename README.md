# NI-EC50-Linear
This is a Repository of R Resources to apply a Linear Regression - based approach to calculate Nitrification Inhibition EC50 values 

I include here the the R project file, the R script in a form of an .Rmd file, along with an R Markdown HTML file, a .txt file with a dataset and the outputs produced from the script 

You can find the .html file if you follow this:
